Just peel off the paper backing and press down where you want your circuit to go. 
Copper tape is used to provide the current from one part of the circuit to another like a battery and LEDs. 
Tape LEDs to the paper and connect the long leg to the positive side of the battery and the short leg to the negative side of the battery.
Tape the battery to the corner so that when the corner is folded, the battery touches the negative connection to cause the LEDs to light up.
